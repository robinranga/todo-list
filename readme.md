# This is a To Do List

I made this website by using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.
I added functionality of -
Adding, Removing and Completing the tasks.
Even the local storage to store the tasks so that you can see them even after reloading the page.
The hover effect to make it more attractive.
The live Time and Date functionality to show on the top of page.

You will listen a sound when the task is completed.
I used poppins font from Google Fonts.
I also used some icons from fontAwesome.
